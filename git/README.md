## What this repo contains atm.

If you want to test the prs of github project automatically, you want to read the code of python*.rb.

This script let you set status of github-prs, (read the prerequisites), and execute some tests against this.

If a test fail, the prs will set to failure (red), otherwise green.

Take inspiration of this script, if you want to test prs on jenkins( is not really a prereq. but would be better ci) !

Happy hacking.
